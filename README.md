# PlantCapture2023 Reproducibility Instructions

### 1. Simulation study
* The simulation study is performed for three models in two sample size scenarios, small city (M,H) = (15, 150) for the first two models and (M,H) = (30, 300) for the last one, and large city (M, H) = (100, 1500).

### 2. Real data analysis
* We provide the analysis of the S-Night dataset which is reconstructed from literature.

### 3. Note
* Some codes need manually edit to fit small city scenario or large city scenario.
